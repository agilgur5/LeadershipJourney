I learned about all sorts of possibilites for my future career and was beginning to think about potentially leadership opportunities such as LDPs (Leadership Development Programs). Many of the companies I was interested in had world class LDPs, and, if anything, it would definitely be a learning experience. <br /> <br /> Lo and behold, in my ENGRG 1050 Seminar, an instructor named Werner Zorman comes to do a class introducing engineering leadership and experiential learning. The class ended being really fun, thought-provoking, and very engaging - it was probably the best 1050 class I'd had so far. If I was already interested in leadership, this definitely sparked my attention. I spoke to Werner after and mentioned some of the opportunities I was interested in and gave him my email. This would be the very beginning of my involvement with the leadership program."

I received an email from Werner about the information sessions and finally decided I would go when I didn't have a prelim lined up that night. As there were only three people in the room and this would be the very first Engineering Leadership Certification class, the session didn't quite inspire me to action. I didn't really care too much about certifications, and the value of the certification wasn't very meaningful either as it wasn't accredited and wouldn't be backed by another class, for instance. It didn't help that one of the upper level classes I wanted to take next semester would be at the exact same timeslot. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I'm glad I met Dan then, was able to speak and relate to him, and got more of an idea of what this program might be. I also learned a bit more about Werner and his aspirations. Looking back, it was probably a good choice that I ended up joining the program, at the very least for the value of the relationships I made. While the lessons I learned may not have been as specific as the Algorithims class I may have taken instead, they were all very significant and impacted my life in many ways."

I guess this is a good start since I didn't want this to be like every other class in the first place. <br /> <br /> We get off the bus and almost immediately get split up into groups... where we would then do a lifeboat exercise. Maybe this is weird of me, but for some reason, I took the exercise really emotionally - all of the people I just met were going to die and we had to choose only three people to survive! I still wish the video of my lifeboat speech wasn't lost, as I'd love to see my emotions, the look on my face, and also show it to a certain someone. Luckily, I still have the journal that we were supposed to write that day, and that brought back a range of emotions. I ended up saying that I did not believe I nor my aspirations were more important than anyone else's. While I normally find this ridiculous to judge or assume, it was even more so since I had just met them and they were probably incredible people too. The only real reason I wanted to live over them was that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with my current girlfriend and get married to her. I did not want to die and lose all that, as it's perhaps my greatest dream, nor make her sad. I told them that if I survived them, I would do my best to honor those that died, give them proper funerals and contact all their loved ones, and do my best to live for them that sacrificed themselves for me and make their aspirations come true as well. <br /> <br /> A bit surprisingly, I ended up getting chosen as one of the three almost unanimously. Spyros was the only one who did not vote for me, and gave a really impressive response - he had said that it was because I had experienced those things already, and that the others had not, that he did not vote for me. That was really thought-provoking and impactful, both the entire exercise and Spyros's statement. Side note: My entire future purpose project team happened to be in that same room that very first day."

Every person ended up talking and ended up sharing a deeply personal story that had significantly impacted their lives. It was amazing both to open up and to hear these stories. I as well as many of my fellow classmates even hugged people after and wanted to help them through their personal struggles already. I told the story of one of the most troubling events in my life to that date and really appreciated being able to finally tell that story. Others told even more troubling stories. All in all, the past two nights were simple incredible. I'd never experienced such an emotional connection with friends, and especially not with people I had just met."

By performing authentically in groups of three, between doing skits, answering questions, and making poses, we were supposed to get the other people in the class to get a feel of what the real, natural type we were. This exercise was really fun and funny too, and I really enjoyed this entire retreat so much I'd love to re-experience it. The photos are really nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I ended up being typed as \"Sage\". This was really exciting and a little bit surprising for me. Secretly, I really wanted to be typed Sage more than anything. I've been trying to be more serene, authentic, passionate, wise, non-judgemental, do more meditation, and practice more Buddhism in general. It felt really good that these attributes and features of myself I've wanted to have be a part of me for so long were actually noticeable to others. I'm not even really sure what made them think that, but I'm glad they did. Thinking back, it was great and really fun to experience the variety of types in the room. Thinking back to my recent experiences and the current day, I feel that I'm a bit out of touch with my type as of late. It might be that I'm just emotionally exhausted and still just really in a lot of pain and unsure how to move forward. It also might be that I've been trying too hard at doing so many things and becoming engineer that I've ended up losing a very important part of myself in the process. Whatever it may be, I still very much want to be a Sage and have all those attributes, and I'm happy I realized this once more and will actively strive to be my type and true self more often again."

I like to make decisions that help me learn, especially about myself and others, that cultivate a feeling of being at home, secure, and loved, that allow me to be balanced, healthy, and energetic, that don't limit my life, my choices, or opportunities, and that keep me genuine and fiercely authentic. <br /> <br /> I try to learn and grow through every experience, find something new and amazing every day. I like to feel secure, to feel wanted, and loved - not just told that, but really appreciated and experience that appreciation, even if in the simplest form (e.g. hugs). Knowing that I have people there for me and people that love me is something I care deeply about, just as much as I care about those people. I appreciate having balance in my life - to not be overworked or emotionally exhausted and to not be totally unproductive either. Having balance allows me to find peace, harmony, and true happiness. Freedom is something I find very inherent and related to Home, security, and balance. I want to be completely in control of my future, as it's something very personal and something uniquely mine. I hate being stuck in certain situations and being limited by imaginary social boundaries and hiearchies. I enjoy and relish in Freedom as much as I do with open-mindedness. Sincerity is something I find I always ending up wanting to give and receive. I try my best to be open and usually find that I'm not open enough. Being genuine and fiercely authentic has always helped me in every situation and improved all of my relationships and I very much enjoy it being reciprocated. <br /> <br /> Looking back on my values, it also feels like I've gotten a bit out of touch with these as well. These are also deeply important to me, and realizing this once again allows me to think much more clearly and also help myself to achieve a state of Peace and balance once again."

Eventually, we settled into having meetings weekly on Wednesdays. We used Skype, Slack, GroupMe, and InvisionApp to greatly aid in our communications and remove email entirely from our workflow. These tools made it much easier and faster to communicate and keep ideas organized.

Unfortunately, I've still found it really difficult to connect to others, in both my work relationships and my friendships. During the course of my exit interview, Erica and I both realized that some of the difficulties I have in speaking (e.g. being repetitive or talking too much) can really adversely affect the really powerful impact I'm able to give. <br /> <br /> What I realized after the interview was that perhaps the reason I have trouble connecting to others may also be due to the fact that I myself am not as open as I may want to be. I really try to connect to others and listen to them and relate to them, but sometimes this causes me to talk too much yet at the same time not really open up about myself. While obviously, to achieve a deeper connection, one of the two parties involved has to be more open, I never thought of myself as being the one to do that for some reason.

It's great to come back to a place you know well, where you can expect to do certain rituals and routines, as well as expect to see and hear certain stories and symbols, just like you do in your own home.

We left many things to the last minute and I also had to admit that I put far too much of the responsibility and burden of the presentation and final product onto myself. I gave nearly every task we had to do over break to myself, and ended up struggling to do those as I was emotionally unstable due to certain events over break. <br /> <br /> All that being said, somehow our presentation turned out really well. We really got it figured out in the last few days, and though we all should have practiced more and together (which we Unfortunately did not get a chance to), it didn't nearly come out as bad as we may have thought it would. Furthermore, our video came out great and had a real impact on the audience. I got really excited was happy to hear that most of the audience was raving for and wanted the product we thought of last semseter all over again. Maybe a lot of things didn't turn out as intended, but everything still turned out fine. <br /> <br /> While there was a decent amount of conflict involved in my group, and I frequently felt that I was doing most of the work as well as most of the teaching, this did show me a real scenario of something I might experience in the future. Dealing with all the conflict, people's schedules, personalities, and differences in a small team really impacted my day to day life. I realized that while it may be great to work with friends and similarly impassioned people, it's also important to find people of equal experience levels and interests. Keeping balance, especially in a small team, is tough, but it helps to ascertain time and interest and distribute work equally and accordingly only after doing this. Furthermore, I realized that being really passionate about a product goes a long way in terms of motivation. Many times throughout our project I found myself losing motivation and inspiration and that I could only regain it through other's passions (whether it be inside our team or from our potential users). There's a large difference between being a bit passionate about something and being extremely passionate about something. Small tasks are also far more rewarding when your passions and aspirations are greater."

Everyone was very appreciative and sad that it was ending already. I really enjoyed meeting, seeing, and interacting with these fantastic people weekly, so I was really sad that this may be the last time I get to see them for an extended period of time. I shared a story about a very troubling event, perhaps the most troubling event that happened to me in my entire life, that had happened just a week ago, and how I was incredibly happy to be here with them right now. The amount of hugs and words of support I received afterward was really incredible and really made me feel loved and appreciated. We really were a great group of people that had each other's backs. <br /> <br /> As the program came to an end, I realized I had learned so much over the past year. I learned how valuable my strengths were, that they could be extremely effective and persuasive when I actually  used them correctly. Leading from my strengths and focusing on my strengths instead of my weaknesses had really changed many things in my life, especially my career, over the past few months. I've also better learned how to make decisions and lead my start up at a much higher level. Everything is no longer guesswork or trial-and-error as I've actually learned some very useful techniques and tactics. Learning through research and hard science about conflict, feedback, decision making, and culture, made me realize quite a large deal of what I was doing both correctly and incorrectly. My presentation and influencing abilities also dramatically increased in impact once I learned the concrete terms and better understood how what I was already doing affected others. <br /> <br /> I can't explain enough how great of an experience this was. While it was quite a bit of work at times, and sometimes extremely stressful as well, it was far more enjoyable and rewarding than any other class I've taken. The relationships I've made are also much deeper and more significant than in any other class, and I'm sure I'll continue treasuring them for many days ahead."

I'm still kind of figuring this out, so I'm not entirely sure what this will entail. But what I do know is that it will require a lot of courage. <br /> <br /> To me, courage is the ability to step out of my comfort zone. To do things I might not do on an every day basis or that may even be a bit unnatural. It's the willingness to take risks, try new things, and do things differently. Some of the biggest places in my life where I have to be courageous is with friends. I've always had a tough time making connections, and though I've always known the importance of friendship and always highly valued my friends, I've only recently come to realize just how necessary they are. I need to be courageous to be able to rely on others, to open up to others and really say how I feel. The leadership program, the people in it, and the events that transpired at the same time have taught me so many things that have really been helpful in the past months. I can't describe enough how appreciative I am of these things and how they've helped me move forward and make next steps. <br /> <br /> I also need to be courageous so that I don't fear entirely new places and people. Where my career and aspirations take me, nobody really knows, but I have to be comfortable going wherever life takes me, while at the same time knowing myself and my personal limits."
