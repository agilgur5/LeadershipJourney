I learned about all sorts of possibilites for my future career and was beginning to think about potentially leadership opportunities such as LDPs (Leadership Development Programs). Many of the companies I was interested in had world class LDPs, and, if anything, it would definitely be a learning experience. <br /> <br /> Lo and behold, in my ENGRG 1050 Seminar, an instructor named Werner Zorman comes to do a class introducing engineering leadership and experiential learning. The class ended being really fun, thought-provoking, and very engaging - it was probably the best 1050 class I'd had so far. If I was already interested in leadership, this definitely sparked my attention. I spoke to Werner after and mentioned some of the opportunities I was interested in and gave him my email. This would be the very beginning of my involvement with the leadership program."

As there were only three people in the room and this would be the very first Engineering Leadership Certification class, the session didn't quite inspire me to action. I didn't really care too much about certifications, and the value of the certification wasn't very meaningful either as it wasn't accredited and wouldn't be backed by another class, for instance. It didn't help that one of the upper level classes I wanted to take next semester would be at the exact same timeslot. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I'm glad I met Dan then, was able to speak and relate to him, and got more of an idea of what this program might be. I also learned a bit more about Werner and his aspirations. Looking back, it was probably a good choice that I ended up joining the program, at the very least for the value of the relationships I made. While the lessons I learned may not have been as specific as the Algorithims class I may have taken instead, they were all very significant and impacted my life in many ways."

I guess this is a good start since I didn't want this to be like every other class in the first place. <br /> <br /> We get off the bus and almost immediately get split up into groups... where we would then do a lifeboat exercise. Maybe this is weird of me, but for some reason, I took the exercise really emotionally - all of the people I just met were going to die and we had to choose only three people to survive! I still wish the video of my lifeboat speech wasn't lost, as I'd love to see my emotions, the look on my face, and also show it to a certain someone. Luckily, I still have the journal that we were supposed to write that day, and that brought back a range of emotions. I ended up saying that I did not believe I nor my aspirations were more important than anyone else's. While I normally find this ridiculous to judge or assume, it was even more so since I had just met them and they were probably incredible people too. The only real reason I wanted to live over them was that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with my current girlfriend and get married to her. I did not want to die and lose all that, as it's perhaps my greatest dream, nor make her sad. I told them that if I survived them, I would do my best to honor those that died, give them proper funerals and contact all their loved ones, and do my best to live for them that sacrificed themselves for me and make their aspirations come true as well. <br /> <br /> A bit surprisingly, I ended up getting chosen as one of the three almost unanimously. Spyros was the only one who did not vote for me, and gave a really impressive response - he had said that it was because I had experienced those things already, and that the others had not, that he did not vote for me. That was really thought-provoking and impactful, both the entire exercise and Spyros's statement.

I as well as many of my fellow classmates even hugged people after and wanted to help them through their personal struggles already. I told the story of one of the most troubling events in my life to that date and really appreciated being able to finally tell that story. Others told even more troubling stories. All in all, the past two nights were simple incredible. I'd never experienced such an emotional connection with friends, and especially not with people I had just met."

This exercise was really fun and funny too, and I really enjoyed this entire retreat so much I'd love to re-experience it. The photos are really nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I ended up being typed as \"Sage\". This was really exciting and a little bit surprising for me. Secretly, I really wanted to be typed Sage more than anything. I've been trying to be more serene, authentic, passionate, wise, non-judgemental, do more meditation, and practice more Buddhism in general. It felt really good that these attributes and features of myself I've wanted to have be a part of me for so long were actually noticeable to others. I'm not even really sure what made them think that, but I'm glad they did. Thinking back, it was great and really fun to experience the variety of types in the room. Thinking back to my recent experiences and the current day, I feel that I'm a bit out of touch with my type as of late. It might be that I'm just emotionally exhausted and still just really in a lot of pain and unsure how to move forward. It also might be that I've been trying too hard at doing so many things and becoming engineer that I've ended up losing a very important part of myself in the process. Whatever it may be, I still very much want to be a Sage and have all those attributes, and I'm happy I realized this once more and will actively strive to be my type and true self more often again."

I like to feel secure, to feel wanted, and loved - not just told that, but really appreciated and experience that appreciation, even if in the simplest form (e.g. hugs). Knowing that I have people there for me and people that love me is something I care deeply about, just as much as I care about those people. I appreciate having balance in my life - to not be overworked or emotionally exhausted and to not be totally unproductive either. Having balance allows me to find peace, harmony, and true happiness. Freedom is something I find very inherent and related to Home, security, and balance. I want to be completely in control of my future, as it's something very personal and something uniquely mine. I hate being stuck in certain situations and being limited by imaginary social boundaries and hiearchies. I enjoy and relish in Freedom as much as I do with open-mindedness. Sincerity is something I find I always ending up wanting to give and receive. I try my best to be open and usually find that I'm not open enough. Being genuine and fiercely authentic has always helped me in every situation and improved all of my relationships and I very much enjoy it being reciprocated. <br /> <br /> Looking back on my values, it also feels like I've gotten a bit out of touch with these as well. These are also deeply important to me, and realizing this once again allows me to think much more clearly and also help myself to achieve a state of Peace and balance once again."

		read_more_html: "The two people I ended up drawing as my Inner Critic and Inner Champion ended up being me at a very specific time and Luffy, one of my favorite anime characters. I think the times when my Inner Critic is most harsh is when I'm late to anything. I typically hate being late, it usually causes me all sorts of worries and nervous thoughts, and it makes me blame myself and get incredibly frustrated. Usually though, my lateness doesn't affect much, but nonetheless, it's something I've struggled to fix over the years. The best way I've found to manage my lateness is to simply change my mindset, it's not that I have to be there at \"this\" exact time, but several minutes earlier so that I'm on time. Or, as the saying goes \"If you're early, you're on time, if you're on time, you're late, and if you're late, you're screwed\". I also don't generally like deadlines and strict schedules, because frequently, not always though, being a bit late does not have a huge impact, and I'd rather not go through the stress of struggling for a deadline when there isn't much of a difference being late. Partially for this reason, and related to my core value of Freedom, my Inner Champion is Luffy, who is a symbol of freedom. I don't enjoy being restricted by societal norms, deadlines, etc, and recognizing that I'm free in so many ways (including free to not do something if I don't want to) is what makes him my Inner Champion. <br /> <br />  My inner critic sometimes gets to me when I'm nervous about something, like an interview, public speaking, or meeting new people. This isn't nearly as bad as the other times, and typically I'm just able to do it fine when I remind myself of past situations. The other derailer I typically have is to get too involved into something, when I should really quit while I'm still ahead. To get through this, I've found that accurately judging things with an importance to time ratio can be quite valuable. Another bad tendency I have is that when I get frustrated, unstable, or unbalanced because of something, the effects of that seep into many other activities. Sometimes I can't seem to forget about what's bothering me or I can't seem to figure out how to fix it. In cases like this, it helps to radically change my perspective for a day and do something really different. Being very mindful for an entire day is one way that has helped as well, as I then quickly realize my negative sprial of emotions."

Some of the things I do to stabilize myself and keep myself happy include watching anime, hanging out with friends and my girlfriend, playing sports, mainly frisbee, fencing, and tennis, working out, napping, being outside, making or playing music, meditating, and sometimes playing video games. I enjoy sharing experiences with my girlfriend and close friends - these things are probably the things that keep me most healthy and happy as these relationships are deeply important to me. I should probably meditate, be outside, and exercise more, as I haven't done those in a while and they are things that I enjoy and that keep me balanced."

It ends up that all the things I've wanted to be and the strengths I've wanted to have... I do indeed possess. To me, a great leader is someone who remains calm and collected throughout stressful and frustrating times. A great leader is one that can inspire action and who others will follow not because of some title or prestige, but because they believe in him/her. Great leaders understand and empathize with others, trust in their intuition, lead from their strengths, and rely on others. <br /> <br /> Reflected Best Self was one of the hardest assignments I've ever gotten. Asking for feedback from my old teachers and friends was no easy task for me, but somehow I got it done (albeit very last minute). I was really surprised and really happy by the responses I got. Some of the teachers I asked wrote nicer things in the feedback than they did in my yearbook! It made me really happy to know that people noticed the dedication I put into my commitments, the responsibility I place on all of my actions, and the enthusiasm I bring to all of my interests. I was also glad that my friends noticed how much I treasured them and cared about them and our relationship. I also learned that apparently my intuition and strategies are often correct, and that I should really go with my gut more often. <br /> <br /> StrengthsQuest pointed out that my top strengths were Achiever, Responsibility, Communication, Empathy, and Strategic. My strengths extended across all four domains, executing, influencing, relationship building, and strategic thinking, meaning I have a breadth of strengths that I can rely on in many ways, especially when mixed together. I'm able to understand and empathize with others, communicate with them well, while at the same time think very well strategically, take great responsibility and achieve it very well. In combination, it means I can be a leader that has the capacity to build strong relationships, develop solid plans, influence people, and execute well. That seems like quite the amazing combination actually... now all I have to do is build those strengths up to an even higher degree where I can really make use of them!"

		read_more_html: "Figuring out what your purpose is is no simple process. It requires really knowing oneself and understanding one's own needs, wants, and hungers. I still don't quite think I entirely know my purpose, but these exercises brought me really close. <br /> <br /> I realized that the things I've always been incredibly passionate about are actually my hungers, are actually things that I want to be in the world, things that I want to change in the world. I want to be free, to have a world to freely explore, to find my niche and people that love me for who I am. I also want to help others find their niches and loved ones, to liberate others and give them freedom. I want to liberate others from the shackles that the world and society places on them; I want them to feel free and meaningful, to see opportunity lurking at every corner, to be happy, to find their purpose, their niche, and people who love them for who they are. <br /> <br /> I realized that I want to create a more free and open world, one full of understanding, exploration, and opportunity. As a software engineer and entreprenuer, I've always tried to think of ways that technology could really change the world to better liberate others and make it easier to come to mutual understanding with others. <br /> <br /> I've always been passionate about virtual reality, and even more so in recent years. I'm not sure how much it matters to me whether or not I create it, but I certainly want to be involved, or at the very least, promote and move forward the entire industry. Ideally, I'd like to make the world's first Full Dive Experience. Imagine laying in bed, putting on a helmet, and all of a sudden being transported into an entirely new realm, one you've never seen before. The experiences one could have are endless and literally infinite. Forget teleportation and transportation, we can virtually be together with anyone, anywhere, even in places that we have yet to imagine of. Creating the Full Dive Experience, especially at an affordable price, could be the key to liberating the world, as it can open up an infinite range of virtual opportunities. Virtual reality also strongly relates to my hunger of connecting others, finding niches, being loved, and helping others find their place. Many times in life, people may wish for an escape, even if temporary, to just get out the day to day problems and stresses of life and do something different, something new. What if an infinite number of universes were at the touch of your fingers? A new perspective, a vacation, a different landscape, all are not too far away with virtual reality. I feel like it could also significantly improve the lives of those that are depressed, lost, or mentally ill. It can help them find places and people they can empathize with and find mutual understanding with more easily than ever. It can provide a temporary escape and give someone a whole new experience. <br /> <br /> While virtual reality may certainly break many barriers for communciation, especially by allowing any group of people to meet up from anywhere in the world, it doesn't significantly improve mutual understanding. I've found that the largest problems I have occur due to misunderstandings more than anything. Human conflict seems to be a result of so much misunderstanding - if people could truly see what others were thinking, perhaps conflict would be much less frequent. With that, I came up with another potential purpose of mine, to build a system that can encode and decode memories. What if instead of telling you how I feel or telling you what happened, I could just show you? And within an instant at that. It would change communication forever and would finally allow people to have some glimpse into the minds and thoughts of others. It could also greatly enhance learning and speed up development in all sectors. <br /> <br /> At the cross-section of entreprenuership and engineering, I'm in a unique position to leverage both of my abilities and communities to potentially move forward and inspire a new industry. I'd like to eventually lead my own team of neuroscientists and engineers to build technology that improves our understanding of the mind, to enhance both virtual reality and mutual understanding. One of the first things I'd like to try is to bring together three separate start ups and industries, virtual reality headsets, including Oculus, EEG and brainwave technology, including Emotiv, and infinite, procedurally generated 3D gaming, including No Man's Sky, into one encompassing product - infinite virtual worlds experienced with a 3D headset through a character controlled by the mind."

You're not really listening very much at all to the other person and if you are, you're thinking about how what they're saying relates to you, not how it affects them. Level 1 typically involves a lack of attention and perhaps multi-tasking. Level 2 - The focus is on what the other person says. You're focusing on the other person and really trying to understand what they're saying. You're not distracted and are trying to empathize. Level 3 - The focus is on what the other person says and doesn't say. Level 3 listening essentially involves reading in between the lines, really using your empathy and trying to understand the emotions and values of the other person. You're not just listening to the content of their words, but also the reasons behind them. <br /> <br /> I didn't even know there were levels of listening! I just kind of thought there was bad, and good. Bad being Level 1 and good being Level 2. Not surprisingly, the majority of my listening involves Level 2 listening. But Level 1 listening isn't necessarily bad, and each of the levels have their own unique purposes. Understanding what the levels are and when to use them has been essential in improving my ability to connect with and understand others."

That actually really helped me get myself psyched as well as take away any fears or nervousness about public speaking... in front of a camera nonetheless. I think the initial part of my pitch really went well and really related to my hunger and purpose. As I realized a few months later, \"My Stuff, Your Space\" was a great idea, but not something I was all too passionate about. After re-watching my presentation, I also seemed to lose the intensity I had at the beginning of my pitch when I began to talk about it. <br /> <br />Thinking back, I believe I would have much rather preferred to pitch my other idea: The Full Dive Experience. Probably my biggest hunger is to make virtual reality a reality, to allow anyone to seamlessly move their consciousness to a virtual world, essentially \"going to sleep\", not moving your current body, and a waking in a new world. A great first step would have been to sync a 3D virtual reality headset with an EEG brainwave reading device - imagine playing a virtual reality game just using your mind."

The largest problem, which probably throughout the entire duration of our purpose project remained one of the largest problems, was that I was the only experienced programmer. To add to the dismay, I later found out I was also the only one who could really do an user interface design and who, initially at least, had any knowledge of product and start up engineering. Choosing a tech heavy project, while aligning with our passions, likely was not too great of a decision due to this heavy problem, which broke tips 1 and 3. Ironically, we thought we wouldn't get stuck planning due to the heavy engineering focus of our project, but perhaps due to the lack of experience of our team, ended up being quite the problem.

Eventually, we settled into having meetings weekly on Wednesdays. We used Skype, Slack, GroupMe, and InvisionApp to greatly aid in our communications and remove email entirely from our workflow. These tools made it much easier and faster to communicate and keep ideas organized. I think the biggest thing I learned during this communication phase is that a strict schedule and proper tools are absolutely essential for productivity when working remotely and not in-person."

Depending on the task we're brainstorming and the goals of the session, we can utilize different strategies (some more independent, such as taking a few minutes to jot down ideas then coming back together, and some more co-dependent, such as going around) in order to greatly improve our brainstorming experience. I've also found successful brainstorming sessions to be very few, but the ones that are are pretty amazing, and these techniques have certainly helped to raise the frequency of those successes. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest lesson I learned here was to not say \"No, but\"."

We also took a survey and learned what our conflict resolution styles were (mine was collaborative!). Our purpose project teams took surveys at the same time to figure out the conflicts within our teams so that we can resolve them sooner rather than later. Breaking down and formally learning conflict resolution styles and techniques made it a lot more logical and methodical in my head, which I hope will help in my future conflicts.

We also had an entire topic on engineering ethics in the entreprenuership class I took last spring, and that was taught very well too, so this was a bit repetitive for me. Park went through several case studies of historical engineering ethics, including the Harvard cheating scandal, a Bell Labs employee's fake publications, and improper cement checking in order to promise faster deadlines. <br /> <br /> Having gone over this topic a third time, I personally feel that I would much rather make a decision by my own ethical and moral standards, rather than commiting violations that may be considered the norm. I know that I won't regret making a decision based on my own principles, but that I may certainly come to regret a decision I made \"just because everyone else was doing it\". When I've seen and heard people cheating, I've never joined in, even if most of the class was doing it, and if I ever thought my grade was at stake as a result or that I was in a place to make this known, I always did so.

Unfortunately, I've still found it really difficult to connect to others, in both my work relationships and my friendships. During the course of my exit interview, Erica and I both realized that some of the difficulties I have in speaking (e.g. being repetitive or talking too much) can really adversely affect the really powerful impact I'm able to give. <br /> <br /> What I realized after the interview was that perhaps the reason I have trouble connecting to others may also be due to the fact that I myself am not as open as I may want to be. I really try to connect to others and listen to them and relate to them, but sometimes this causes me to talk too much yet at the same time not really open up about myself. While obviously, to achieve a deeper connection, one of the two parties involved has to be more open, I never thought of myself as being the one to do that for some reason.

Instead of slacking off or doing something unimportant, take that time to start working on the things that really matter to you, your goals. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Goalden Hour ended as an unfinished product that may yet be completed at a later date. Being very engineering focused, as well as having a heavy reliance on design and product, much of the work came down to me. As we came to realize that the other people who knew how to program really couldn't contribute much at all to the development of the app, essentially the entire app came down to me. Frankly, that's too much work that I can't bear nor have time to bear. I'm also not an app developer, so this only made it tougher for me. I tried leveraging my web development skills to build a hybrid app that could be deployed on various operating systems at the same time, only to quickly realize that this was actually harder and more tedious than simply doing native development. While there would some code to share across platforms this way, much of the code for integrating with calendars, notifications, and other native capabilities, required writing custom code for each platform anyway. This realization of course, came a bit too late, and while I do have a bit of experience programming on iOS and Android, it would take me even longer to create a native app as it would require a great deal of learning along the way. Even after narrowing down our MVP to not include a back end for syncing across devices, this was still too great of a burden for one person. Especially when I was heavily involved in everything else, such as our video, where most of the script was written by me. <br /> <br /> While Goalden Hour did not come to fruition by the end of the leadership program, the renewed interest in it at the end of the program may one day inspire me to once again start building Goalden Hour."

We left many things to the last minute and I also had to admit that I put far too much of the responsibility and burden of the presentation and final product onto myself. I gave nearly every task we had to do over break to myself, and ended up struggling to do those as I was emotionally unstable due to certain events over break. <br /> <br /> All that being said, somehow our presentation turned out really well. We really got it figured out in the last few days, and though we all should have practiced more and together (which we Unfortunately did not get a chance to), it didn't nearly come out as bad as we may have thought it would. Furthermore, our video came out great and had a real impact on the audience. I got really excited was happy to hear that most of the audience was raving for and wanted the product we thought of last semseter all over again. Maybe a lot of things didn't turn out as intended, but everything still turned out fine. <br /> <br /> While there was a decent amount of conflict involved in my group, and I frequently felt that I was doing most of the work as well as most of the teaching, this did show me a real scenario of something I might experience in the future. Dealing with all the conflict, people's schedules, personalities, and differences in a small team really impacted my day to day life. I realized that while it may be great to work with friends and similarly impassioned people, it's also important to find people of equal experience levels and interests. Keeping balance, especially in a small team, is tough, but it helps to ascertain time and interest and distribute work equally and accordingly only after doing this. Furthermore, I realized that being really passionate about a product goes a long way in terms of motivation. Many times throughout our project I found myself losing motivation and inspiration and that I could only regain it through other's passions (whether it be inside our team or from our potential users). There's a large difference between being a bit passionate about something and being extremely passionate about something. Small tasks are also far more rewarding when your passions and aspirations are greater."

The amount of hugs and words of support I received afterward was really incredible and really made me feel loved and appreciated. We really were a great group of people that had each other's backs. <br /> <br /> As the program came to an end, I realized I had learned so much over the past year. I learned how valuable my strengths were, that they could be extremely effective and persuasive when I actually  used them correctly. Leading from my strengths and focusing on my strengths instead of my weaknesses had really changed many things in my life, especially my career, over the past few months. I've also better learned how to make decisions and lead my start up at a much higher level. Everything is no longer guesswork or trial-and-error as I've actually learned some very useful techniques and tactics. Learning through research and hard science about conflict, feedback, decision making, and culture, made me realize quite a large deal of what I was doing both correctly and incorrectly. My presentation and influencing abilities also dramatically increased in impact once I learned the concrete terms and better understood how what I was already doing affected others. <br /> <br /> I can't explain enough how great of an experience this was. While it was quite a bit of work at times, and sometimes extremely stressful as well, it was far more enjoyable and rewarding than any other class I've taken.
